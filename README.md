# Arduino-Master-Code
This is standard set of files used in Arduino and Various sensors for reading the sensors and providing an output on attached device. This is whole list of components which I had previously tested myself during the project working or learning process.
If you are finding difficulty with any of code and it is not working as supposed to please bring it into my notice.
